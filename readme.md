# 🧠 Academic Assignment Generator

## 📘 Overview
This project is an **automated academic assignment generator** designed to create well-structured, university-level assignments in formal academic English.  
It can generate topic-based assignments with:
- Proper section formatting (`##`, `###` headings)
- Formal introduction, main discussion, and conclusion
- Analytical writing with discipline-specific depth
- Configurable difficulty, length, and structure

Unlike simple Q&A models, this generator organizes content under logical **subheadings**, ensuring a smooth academic flow — suitable for university reports, essays, and coursework.
